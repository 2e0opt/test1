Welcome to my site it's looking rather slim pickings at the minute but I am working on a bunch of content. Due to the time of year (nearly christmas!!!) things have somewhat
slowed down and due to restrictions I'm having to wait for the postman to bring things. Some things I have planned are a spot of antenna wrangling and getting onto 4m and which radio is the best for doing so.
Also Digital voice and my personal favourite digital modes on HF and *hopefully* VHF/UHF.

Anyway I've rambled for long enough so I will wish you 73 for now.

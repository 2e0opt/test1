Hey there my name is Jon and by the websites title you may have guessed I hold an intermediate amateur radio license. 
My story with amateur radio isn't one thats been being going on for years rather I took my foundation license on the 29th feburary 2020. During the lockdown I didnt have a lot to do so I decided to study for the intermediate license which I passed on the 8th october. 
With us in and out of covid lockdown and the likelyhood of things getting back to normal any time soon I've since started to study for the full UK license but I'm having too much of a blast playings radio to dedicate my full time into it. hopefully some time in 2021 I'll get around to sitting the exam.

### Other stuff

Other things of note I have a interest in computing and electronics in general and I often find something new and interesting to play with. 

### So whats the purpose of this site?
It's a way for me to document what I'm upto even though I may not be the best at writing I do like to try.
